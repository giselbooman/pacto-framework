# Partner Access

## Detailed Specifications

This public repository provides the conceptual foundation for the PACTO framework. Detailed specifications, pilot documentation, mechanism designs, and technical schemas are available to partners through the **KOI Knowledge Commons**.

## What Partners Get Access To

- **Full mechanism specifications** (m020-m023) with JSON schemas and reference implementations
- **Pilot documentation** — detailed context, indicators, and lessons learned from each pilot community
- **Technical architecture** — system components, data flow patterns, deployment models
- **Taxonomy and ontology** — PACTO ontology, indicator frameworks, bridge schemas to Regen Ledger and OPAL
- **Federation configuration** — KOI node configuration, RID addressing, export pipelines
- **Economics documentation** — biocultural credit value flows, payment infrastructure vision
- **Integration specifications** — connections to agentic-tokenomics, Regen Ledger, OPAL, deliberative democracy tools

## How to Access

Partner access is distributed via the KOI (Knowledge Organization Infrastructure) knowledge commons, not via public GitHub. This ensures:

1. **Appropriate context** — detailed specifications are shared with partners who understand the cultural sensitivity requirements
2. **Community protection** — pilot-specific content is shared only with partners who have committed to the Beyond-FPIC principles
3. **Living documentation** — partner content is updated through KOI federation, ensuring partners always have the latest versions

### To request partner access:

- **Existing Regen ecosystem partners:** Contact the PACTO team via [forum.regen.network](https://forum.regen.network)
- **Conservation organizations:** Reach out through the [Regen Registry](https://registry.regen.network) partner program
- **Research institutions:** Contact via the forum with your research context
- **Indigenous communities and their allies:** Contact us directly — community access is prioritized

## Open Design Questions

PACTO has several unresolved design questions that benefit from partner input:

- **Tool vs. Certification:** Is PACTO an enabling tool, a registry requirement, or both?
- **Consensus Thresholds:** What constitutes sufficient agreement? Community-defined.
- **Language Model Sovereignty:** Path to sovereign inference models for indigenous languages.
- **ERA Brazil Relationship:** Standalone biocultural method or module integration?

These tensions are documented, not resolved. Partner input shapes the direction.
