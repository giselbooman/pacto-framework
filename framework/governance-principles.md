# Governance Principles: Beyond FPIC

PACTO establishes a governance framework that goes beyond Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC).

---

## Core Principle: Co-Design, Not Consent

FPIC asks: "Do you agree to what we propose?"
PACTO asks: "What do you want, and how do we build it together?"

| Dimension | FPIC | PACTO |
|-----------|------|-------|
| **Direction** | External to Community | Community to External |
| **Community role** | Reviewer | Author |
| **Authority over terms** | Limited (accept/reject) | Full (define/modify) |
| **Temporal scope** | Point-in-time consent | Ongoing co-design |
| **Evidence** | Consent documented | Entire process documented |
| **Amendment** | Renegotiation required | Living contract protocol |

## Assembly Protocols

### Respect Existing Governance

PACTO does not introduce new governance structures. It instruments existing ones — indigenous assemblies, tribal councils, community meetings, or any locally recognized decision-making forum.

The community decides: when to convene, who participates, what governance rules apply, what constitutes a quorum, how decisions are ratified.

### Voice-First Participation

Oral participation is the primary interface. PACTO accommodates:

- **Oral-only participants** — community members who cannot read or write participate through voice, with equal weight
- **Multi-language deliberation** — internal discussion in community language, formal capture in administrative language
- **Visual and symbolic expression** — maps, drawings, gestures as valid input
- **Elder authority** — traditional knowledge holders participate through oral traditions and cultural protocols

### Community Authority at Every Step

| Core Loop Step | Community Authority |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Assembly | Community convenes on its own terms |
| Voice Capture | Community approves capture methods and data handling |
| Synthesis | AI output is provisional; community word is final |
| Feedback | Community corrects, affirms, or rejects synthesis |
| Refinement | Community sets consensus threshold and iteration rules |
| Agreement | Community endorses final terms; can withdraw at any time |

---

## Data Sovereignty

1. **Community ownership** — assembly recordings, transcripts, and synthesis outputs belong to the community
2. **Community-defined access** — the community determines who can access their data
3. **Right to withdraw** — communities can request removal of their content at any time
4. **Storage self-determination** — communities choose where their data is stored
5. **No extraction without reciprocity** — every use of community data must add value for the community

## The Beyond-FPIC Checklist

For any work involving indigenous knowledge, community processes, or pilot-specific content:

- [ ] **Community authorship** — was this generated through a PACTO process?
- [ ] **Community endorsement** — has the community reviewed and affirmed it?
- [ ] **Data sovereignty** — does it respect the community's data requirements?
- [ ] **Attribution** — is the contributing community properly credited?
- [ ] **No extraction** — does it add value for the community?
- [ ] **Language integrity** — has translation been verified by a community member?
- [ ] **Power dynamics** — does it risk creating dependency or externally-imposed frameworks?
- [ ] **Reversibility** — can the community withdraw this content?

## Legal Pluralism

PACTO-generated agreements may need to be simultaneously valid under multiple legal frameworks:

| Legal Framework | Scope |
|----------------|-------|
| **Indigenous customary law** | Community governance, traditional authority |
| **National law** | State recognition, contract enforcement |
| **On-chain governance** | Ledger state, smart contract execution |
| **International frameworks** | UNDRIP, CBD, TNFD |

PACTO does not attempt to resolve legal pluralism in the abstract — it provides the process for communities to navigate it with appropriate legal support.

## Power Dynamics Safeguards

The use of AI in indigenous community processes carries specific risks. PACTO mitigates them through:

- **Community override** at every AI-mediated step
- **Community endorsement** required before any knowledge is published
- **Indigenous language preservation** — translations flagged for community review
- **AI synthesis is always provisional** — community word is final
- **Voice-first design** — no requirement for digital literacy
- **Temporal compression serves community goals**, not funder timelines
