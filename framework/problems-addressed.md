# The Problems PACTO Addresses

PACTO exists because existing approaches to community engagement in ecological crediting and conservation fail communities in four distinct ways. These are not abstract problems — they are grounded in field experience with indigenous communities in the Amazon Basin and recur across the global conservation landscape.

## Problem 1: The Consent Gap

The standard approach to community engagement relies on Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC). FPIC is necessary but insufficient — it is too low a bar.

Legal contracts are drafted by professionals in technical language, then presented to communities for sign-off. The information asymmetry is enormous: professionals have months of preparation, legal language, and detailed technical knowledge. Community participants have hours to review documents in a language that may not be their primary one.

**What PACTO changes:** Communities define the terms, indicators, and governance structures of ecological agreements from the ground up. The community's voice is the primary source material. Legal professionals translate community intent into enforceable language — not the reverse.

| FPIC | PACTO |
|------|-------|
| Consent (yes/no) | Co-design (authorship) |
| Informed by external parties | Generated by community assembly |
| Prior to implementation | Continuous throughout agreement lifecycle |
| Free from coercion | Free to define the terms themselves |
| Minimum bar for engagement | Process for creating durable agreements |

## Problem 2: The NGO Industrial Complex

Indigenous communities, particularly in the Amazon, experience a fragmented landscape of NGO-driven projects that create more problems than they solve:

- **Intra-community competition** — multiple NGOs approach the same community with different projects, creating factions
- **Inconsistent commitments** — projects make promises tied to funding cycles that collapse when grants end
- **External frameworks** — conservation approaches designed far from the communities they affect are presented as fait accompli
- **Priorities mismatch** — what the NGO wants to conserve and what the community considers important may not align
- **Accountability inversion** — communities are accountable to funders, but funders are rarely accountable to communities

**What PACTO changes:** PACTO reverses the direction of design authority. Instead of external organizations designing projects and seeking community buy-in, the community designs the agreement and external organizations provide the infrastructure to make it operational.

## Problem 3: The Temporal Compression Challenge

Building trust and developing participatory agreements with indigenous communities currently takes approximately **18 months**. This means higher costs, fewer communities reached, funder impatience leading to shortcuts, and community fatigue from extended engagement.

**What PACTO changes:** PACTO compresses the timeline to 2-3 intensive multi-day assembly events while maintaining or exceeding the depth and quality of outcomes. The compression comes from AI-augmented synthesis that accelerates the capture, structuring, and feedback of community input — not from rushing deliberation.

## Problem 4: The Surveillance Inversion

Most technology deployed in conservation contexts serves surveillance functions — satellite monitoring watches deforestation, IoT sensors track compliance, MRV systems verify claims against communities. Technology flows downward: funders and verifiers watch communities.

**What PACTO inverts:** Technology serves communities, reflecting their own desires in the contracts being created. The Evidence Trail verifies that the community drove the process — not that the community complied with external requirements.

| Surveillance Pattern | PACTO Inversion |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Technology watches communities | Technology **serves** communities |
| Verifies claims against communities | Verifies that **communities drove the process** |
| Measures what funders care about | Measures what the **community defines as important** |

## How the Four Problems Interact

These problems reinforce each other. The Consent Gap means communities don't shape agreements. The NGO Industrial Complex means external organizations design projects without community input. Temporal pressures lead to shortcuts. Surveillance technology monitors compliance with terms communities didn't write.

PACTO addresses all four simultaneously through the Core Loop — a single process that makes communities the authors, reverses the NGO dynamic, compresses timelines through AI-augmented synthesis, and inverts surveillance by making technology serve community voice.

*These four problems define why PACTO exists. Every specification in the framework should be evaluated against whether it helps address one or more of them.*
