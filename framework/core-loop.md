# The PACTO Core Loop

The Core Loop is the architectural backbone of PACTO. It is a 6-step iterative process that transforms community deliberation into formal, legally binding ecological agreements.

## The 6 Steps

### Step 1: Community Assembly

The community convenes using its **existing governance and decision-making processes** — indigenous assembly structures, tribal councils, community meetings, or whatever governance tradition the community already practices. PACTO does not introduce a new meeting format. It instruments an existing one.

Deliberation happens in mixed languages. In Amazonian contexts, communities discuss internally in their own language, then shift to Spanish for formal capture and external communication.

**Key principle:** The community decides when and how to convene. PACTO does not impose a schedule, quorum, or agenda.

### Step 2: Voice-to-Text Capture

Assembly proceedings are transcribed in real-time using voice-to-text tools. The transcription is the **primary source material** of community deliberation — the raw evidence of what the community said, in their words.

**Data sovereignty:** Transcripts are community property. Storage location and access controls are community-defined. Content-hash anchoring provides timestamping without requiring community data to live on-chain.

### Step 3: AI-Assisted Synthesis

AI processing extracts key themes, priorities, points of agreement, and points of tension from the transcript. This produces structured summaries:

1. **What the community said** about what they want
2. **How it relates** to the structure of agreements being developed
3. **Where there are open questions** or disagreements requiring further deliberation

**Quality safeguard:** AI synthesis is always provisional. It is subject to community correction in Step 4. The system never presents synthesis as authoritative — it is a structured mirror held up for the community to examine.

### Step 4: Feedback Presentation

The synthesized output is presented back to the community:

> "This is what you just said about what you want."

The community reviews, corrects, and affirms. This is the critical accountability step — it closes the loop between what the community actually said and what the technology captured and structured.

**Community actions at this step:**
- **Affirm:** "Yes, that captures what we said."
- **Correct:** "No, that's not what we meant."
- **Expand:** "You missed something important."
- **Reject:** "Start over."

### Step 5: Iterative Refinement

Steps 1-4 repeat in loops until the community reaches consensus. Each cycle sharpens the agreement terms, refines indicators, and resolves tensions.

**Consensus threshold:** This is a configurable, community-defined parameter. Different communities may define different thresholds — simple majority, supermajority, unanimous consent, or traditional decision-making protocols.

**Temporal compression:** PACTO aims to achieve in 2-3 intensive multi-day events what traditionally takes ~18 months of meetings. The AI-augmented synthesis accelerates the iteration without compromising depth.

### Step 6: Agreement Generation

The final synthesis becomes the foundation for formal legal instruments:

- **Conservation easements** — land-use restrictions defined by community
- **Payment-for-ecosystem-service contracts** — payment terms linked to community-defined indicators
- **Credit issuance terms** — parameters for ecological credit generation
- **Living contracts** — adaptive agreements with community-controlled amendment protocols

**Key distinction:** These agreements are rooted in verbatim community voice, not lawyer-drafted boilerplate presented for sign-off. Legal professionals translate community intent into enforceable language — not the reverse.

## The Evidence Trail

PACTO creates a transparent, verifiable record of the participatory process itself — not just the outcome. This is MRV (Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification) of the participatory process:

| Evidence Layer | What Is Recorded |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Assembly convening** | Date, participants, governance structure used |
| **Voice capture** | Audio/transcript content hashes |
| **Synthesis outputs** | Each synthesis version with provenance |
| **Feedback records** | Community corrections, affirmations, rejections |
| **Iteration history** | Number of cycles, changes between versions |
| **Final agreement** | Endorsed agreement with community endorsement |

Funders and verifiers can see that the community actually drove the agreement terms, that deliberation happened, and that consent was genuine.

## The Surveillance Inversion

Most technology deployed in conservation contexts serves surveillance functions — monitoring compliance, tracking deforestation, verifying claims against communities. PACTO inverts this:

| Traditional Conservation Tech | PACTO Approach |
|------------------------------|---------------|
| Technology watches communities | Technology serves communities |
| Monitors compliance | Reflects community desires in contracts |
| Data flows to external verifiers | Data stays with community, shared by choice |
| Communities are subjects of monitoring | Communities are authors of agreements |

## Living Agreements

Agreements generated through PACTO are not static documents locked at signing. They are **living contracts** — ongoing, upgradeable agreements where communities make commitments that evolve over time. Amendment occurs through re-running the Core Loop for specific sections.
