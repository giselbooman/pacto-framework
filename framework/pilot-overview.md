# Pilot Overview

PACTO is grounded in real pilot implementations, not abstract theory. Each pilot tests different aspects of the framework in distinct cultural, ecological, and institutional contexts.

## Pilot Map

| Pilot | Location | Status | Primary Value |
|-------|----------|--------|---------------|
| **Siekopai Nation** | Ecuadorian Amazon | Primary pilot | Core Loop validation, biocultural indicator co-definition |
| **Sharamentsa / Shuar** | Ecuadorian Amazon | Contrast case | Demonstrates PACTO's necessity |
| **Matses Nation** | Peruvian Amazon | Invited | Cross-border adaptation |
| **Salmon Nation** | Columbia River Basin (Cascadia) | Emerging | Non-Amazonian context |
| **ASHA** | Amazon Sacred Headwaters | Strategic | Multilateral fund governance framework |

## Siekopai Nation — Primary Pilot

The Siekopai pilot is the most developed PACTO implementation. The Siekopai Nation worked with Regen Network and local implementation partners to develop biocultural indicators for jaguar conservation credits using the PACTO Core Loop.

The process followed the 6 steps: community interviews were transcribed, AI synthesis extracted themes and indicator candidates, the community reviewed and corrected the output, and indicators were co-defined across ecological, cultural, and territorial domains.

**Key learning:** The participatory indicator development process — treating voice data as primary source and looping synthesis back for community validation — works in practice and produces outcomes that communities and partners endorse.

## Sharamentsa / Shuar — Contrast Case

A parallel jaguar credit project that uses the "biocultural" label but did not implement participatory indicator workshops. The project references a Plan de Vida (life plan) as its biocultural anchor but has not defined specific biocultural indicators, monitoring frequency, thresholds, or reporting structures.

**Why this matters:** The contrast between Siekopai and Sharamentsa demonstrates that the word "biocultural" alone does not guarantee community authorship. Without the participatory process, "biocultural" becomes a label without operational substance. This is not a story of failure — it is empirical evidence that participatory process matters.

## Matses Nation — Invited Pilot

An invited pilot for biocultural credit development with the Matses Nation in the Peruvian Amazon. Tests PACTO's applicability across national borders and different indigenous governance structures, with ERA Brazil's umbrella species methodology as the scientific complement.

## Salmon Nation — Emerging Pilot

Biocultural credit development with First Nations communities in the Columbia River Basin, focused on salmon ecosystem health indicators. Tests PACTO's applicability outside tropical forest ecosystems, with different governance traditions, ecological focus, and legal context.

## ASHA — Strategic Pilot

The Amazon Sacred Headwaters Alliance is a multilateral bioregional fund. PACTO has been proposed as a component of its governance framework, serving as the integrity layer for community assembly processes. This is PACTO's highest-scale application — operating across multiple indigenous nations, countries, and ecological contexts.

## Cross-Pilot Patterns

1. **Community assembly is the foundation** — every pilot begins with existing community governance structures
2. **Voice is primary source** — transcription and synthesis of community voice drives indicator and agreement development
3. **Local partners are essential** — PACTO requires trusted intermediaries who understand both the community and the technical stack
4. **Biocultural indicators are community-specific** — no universal indicator set; each community defines what matters in their territorial context
