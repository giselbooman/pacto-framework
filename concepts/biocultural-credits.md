# Biocultural Credits

## What Makes a Credit "Biocultural"

A credit earns "biocultural" status when it meets **both** conditions:

1. **Ecological outcomes** — measurable environmental benefits (carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, habitat quality) verified through standard MRV
2. **Participatory process** — community authorship of agreement terms, demonstrated through the Evidence Trail

Neither alone is sufficient. Ecological outcomes without community authorship are conventional credits. Community participation without ecological measurement is governance documentation, not a tradeable credit.

## The Biocultural Premium

Biocultural credits are expected to command a premium over conventional ecological credits because they:

- **Demonstrate genuine community benefit** — not just consent, but authorship
- **Carry lower reversal risk** — community-authored agreements have higher durability because communities have genuine ownership of the terms
- **Meet emerging ESG requirements** — TNFD (Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures) and SBTi (Science Based Targets initiative) increasingly require demonstration of social co-benefits
- **Provide authentic impact narratives** — for corporate buyers seeking verifiable community-level impact

## How PACTO Creates Biocultural Credits

PACTO provides the process layer that gives biocultural crediting its legitimacy. The framework:

1. Enables communities to **define their own indicators** of ecological and cultural health through the Core Loop
2. Creates a **verifiable Evidence Trail** proving the community drove the agreement terms
3. Produces **formal legal instruments** (conservation easements, credit issuance terms) rooted in community voice
4. Supports **living contracts** that evolve with community needs and ecological conditions

Without verified community authorship, biodiversity credits that claim to be "biocultural" lack the distinguishing characteristic. The contrast between PACTO-process and non-PACTO-process pilot implementations demonstrates this empirically.

## Value Flow Principles

1. **Community-first** — the largest share of credit revenue flows to the community
2. **Transparency** — all revenue splits are defined in the living contract and visible on-chain
3. **Community override** — the community can renegotiate terms through the amendment protocol
4. **No extraction without reciprocity** — every party in the value chain must provide demonstrable value to the community

## Relevant Credit Types on Regen Ledger

| Credit Type | Description | PACTO Relevance |
|-------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **USS01** (Umbrella Species Stewardship) | Composite index: species health + habitat quality + conservation interventions | Primary credit class for Siekopai pilot |
| **BT01** (BioTerra) | Weighted restoration and preservation scoring | Compatible with PACTO process for biodiversity contexts |
| **Carbon** (C01-C09) | GHG accounting per IPCC | Baseline for biocultural co-benefits |

## Open Questions

- What is the right community revenue share? Must be negotiated per community, not set centrally.
- How are credits priced when indicators are community-defined? Market discovery needed.
- Can the biocultural premium be quantified? Requires sales data from first PACTO-originated credits.

*All economic models for biocultural credits require community endorsement through the PACTO Core Loop. No economic model should be imposed without participatory co-design.*
