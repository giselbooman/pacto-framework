# PACTO and Deliberative Democracy

PACTO connects directly to the broader field of deliberative democracy, citizens' assemblies, and digital governance. These connections represent integration points that expand PACTO's capability and reach.

## Where PACTO Fits

PACTO applies deliberative democracy principles — voice-first participation, structured synthesis, iterative consensus building — to **ecological governance** in indigenous and community contexts. Most deliberative democracy tools are designed for civic contexts (voting, policy, urban planning). PACTO adds:

- **Ecological dimension** — deliberation about land, species, ecosystems
- **Indigenous governance** — integration with existing traditional governance structures
- **Legal instrument output** — assemblies produce contracts, not just opinions
- **On-chain anchoring** — verifiable evidence trail on blockchain
- **Biocultural indicators** — community-defined metrics that bridge ecological and cultural values

## Comparison with Existing Approaches

| Approach | Focus | What PACTO Adds |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| **Bloom / dem.brain** | Civic deliberation, voice-to-polis | Ecological governance, on-chain anchoring, legal instruments |
| **Pol.is** | Opinion clustering | Community-defined indicators, legally binding agreements |
| **vTaiwan** | Digital democracy | Indigenous governance integration, legal pluralism |
| **Citizens' assemblies** | In-person deliberation | AI synthesis, temporal compression, evidence trail |
| **Standard FPIC** | Consent for external proposals | Community authorship, not just consent |
| **Plan de Vida** | Community governance documents | Structured indicators, monitoring, on-chain anchoring |

## Technical Convergence

The deliberative democracy space and PACTO share technical foundations:

- **Voice-first input** — both start with spoken participation as the primary interface
- **Claim extraction** — both extract structured positions from unstructured deliberation
- **Consensus visualization** — both make group agreement visible and actionable
- **Iterative refinement** — both use feedback loops to sharpen collective positions

The key difference is output: civic deliberation tools typically produce opinions, recommendations, or votes. PACTO produces formal ecological agreements with legal force.

## Integration Opportunities

Several tools in the deliberative democracy space align with PACTO's architecture:

- **Bridging technology** for cross-cultural communication in assembly settings
- **Claim extraction tools** that complement PACTO's synthesis pipeline
- **Quality tracking systems** that instrument facilitator accuracy over time
- **Opinion mapping** that visualizes community consensus formation

These are documented as future integration points, not current dependencies.
