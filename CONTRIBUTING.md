# Contributing to PACTO / Contribuir a PACTO

**Bienvenidos** — Welcome to the PACTO framework. This is a framework for community-led ecological agreements, and the contribution process reflects that ethos: participatory, transparent, and grounded in real community needs.

## For Human Contributors

### Quick Start

1. **Read** the [README](README.md) to understand the PACTO framework and 6-step Core Loop
2. **Explore** the `framework/` directory for foundational specifications
3. **Review** the [glossary](reference/glossary.md) for key terminology
4. **Join** the conversation on [forum.regen.network](https://forum.regen.network)

### Contribution Types

| Type | Examples |
|------|---------|
| **Research** | Analysis, literature review, comparative studies |
| **Translation** | ES/EN document translation, indigenous terminology review |
| **Facilitation** | Facilitator guides, workshop templates, training materials |
| **Review** | Cultural sensitivity review, specification feedback |

### Style Guide

- Use clear, accessible language — avoid jargon without definition
- Include the Spanish equivalent for key PACTO-specific terms (see [reference/glossary.md](reference/glossary.md))
- Mark unresolved questions explicitly rather than papering over them

## For Community Members

### Voice Contribution Pathway

Community members do not need to write code or documentation to contribute to PACTO. The framework is designed for voice-first participation:

```
Community Voice (assembly, interview, workshop)
        |
        v
Voice-to-Text Capture (transcription)
        |
        v
AI-Assisted Synthesis (structuring themes and priorities)
        |
        v
Community Review (corrections, affirmations)
        |
        v
Structured Knowledge (indicators, agreement terms)
        |
        v
Repository Contribution (with attribution and community endorsement)
```

**Every oral contribution** that enters this repository through the PACTO Core Loop carries attribution to the contributing community and must have community endorsement before publication.

### What Community Members Can Contribute

- **Biocultural indicators** — What does ecological health mean in your territory?
- **Governance parameters** — How does your community make decisions?
- **Process feedback** — Did the PACTO Core Loop work? What should change?
- **Cultural context** — What do outsiders need to understand?
- **Corrections** — Did the AI synthesis get something wrong? Flag it.

### Languages

The repository operates primarily in English and Spanish. Community contributions in indigenous languages are welcomed and will be preserved with their original language alongside translations. We do not machine-translate indigenous language content without community review.

## Beyond Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)

PACTO goes beyond FPIC. For any contribution that involves indigenous knowledge, community processes, or pilot-specific content, review this checklist:

### Checklist

- [ ] **Community authorship**: Was this content generated through a PACTO Core Loop process, or derived from one?
- [ ] **Community endorsement**: Has the contributing community reviewed and affirmed this content?
- [ ] **Data sovereignty**: Does the content respect the community's data residency and ownership requirements?
- [ ] **Attribution**: Is the contributing community properly credited?
- [ ] **No extraction**: Does this contribution add value for the community, not just extract knowledge from them?
- [ ] **Language integrity**: If content was translated from an indigenous language, has the semantic integrity been verified by a community member?
- [ ] **Power dynamics**: Does this contribution risk creating dependency, surveillance, or externally-imposed frameworks?
- [ ] **Reversibility**: Can the community withdraw this content if they later choose to?

### When in Doubt

If a contribution touches indigenous knowledge and you're unsure about compliance: pause, ask, and wait for community review before proceeding.
