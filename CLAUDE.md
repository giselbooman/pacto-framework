## What PACTO Is

PACTO (**Proceso de Acuerdos y Co-Constitucion Tecnologicamente Organizada** / Participatory Assembly & Co-creation Through Technology) is a framework for generating durable, community-authored ecological agreements using participatory assembly processes augmented by AI tooling.

PACTO is a companion to [`regen-network/agentic-tokenomics`](https://github.com/regen-network/agentic-tokenomics), extending it for biocultural participatory contexts.

## Core Thesis

Communities already have governance processes and cultural decision-making rituals. Rather than replacing those with outside legal and technical frameworks, PACTO instruments existing assembly processes with technology that makes them more legible, actionable, and contractually binding — while keeping the community's voice as the primary source of authority.

**PACTO is not FPIC.** It is not a consent process. It is a participatory co-design process in which the community defines the terms, indicators, and governance structures of ecological agreements from the ground up.

## The Four Problems

1. **The Consent Gap** — FPIC is too low a bar. Communities say yes or no but rarely shape the substance.
2. **The NGO Industrial Complex** — Fragmented NGO-driven projects create intra-community competition and funding-cycle collapse.
3. **The Temporal Compression Challenge** — Participatory agreements take ~18 months. PACTO compresses to 2-3 intensive assembly events.
4. **The Surveillance Inversion** — Most conservation technology watches communities. PACTO inverts this.

## The 6-Step Core Loop

1. **Community Assembly** — convenes using existing governance processes
2. **Voice-to-Text Capture** — assembly proceedings transcribed
3. **AI-Assisted Synthesis** — themes, priorities, agreements, tensions extracted
4. **Feedback Presentation** — community reviews, corrects, affirms
5. **Iterative Refinement** — repeat until community consensus
6. **Agreement Generation** — formal legal instruments rooted in community voice

## Cultural Sensitivity Guidelines

**Mandatory when working with PACTO content:**

1. **Never frame PACTO as consent.** Use "participatory co-design," "community authorship," or "assembly-driven agreement."
2. **Respect oral tradition as primary source.** Voice is the primary interface, not a fallback.
3. **Be aware of power dynamics.** AI synthesis is always subject to community correction.
4. **Preserve language integrity.** Flag potential semantic loss in translation.
5. **No extraction without reciprocity.** Contributions must add value for communities.
6. **Present the current state honestly.** Do not overstate maturity.
7. **Legal pluralism awareness.** Flag legal complexity rather than simplifying it away.
