      description: >
        PACTO's core application is community-led ecological agreements
        for biodiversity conservation and land stewardship. Biocultural
        indicators directly measure ecosystem health as defined by
        communities who live in those ecosystems.
      credit_classes: [USS01, BT01]
      indicators:
        - Jaguar population density (Siekopai)
        - Forest canopy cover
        - Habitat connectivity
        - Species diversity indices

        PACTO-generated agreements can include carbon sequestration
        commitments verified through community-defined indicators
        complemented by scientific baselines (soil carbon, NDVI).
      credit_classes: [C01, C02, C03, C04]
      indicators:
        - Soil organic carbon
        - Forest cover maintenance
        - Fire management practices

      description: >
        PACTO strengthens indigenous governance institutions by making
        assembly processes more legible and contractually binding.
        The Evidence Trail provides transparent, accountable
        decision-making records. Community endorsement (m023) is
        participatory democracy in practice.
      indicators:
        - Assembly participation rates
        - Community endorsement coverage
        - Evidence trail completeness

      description: >
        PACTO's biocultural indicator process includes intergenerational
        knowledge transfer — elders defining indicators based on
        traditional ecological knowledge, youth participating in
        assemblies. The process itself is educational.
      indicators:
        - Intergenerational knowledge transfer events
        - Youth participation in indicator definition
        - Traditional ecological knowledge documentation

      domains: [economic]
      mechanisms: [m022]
      description: >
        PACTO agreements include payment terms (PES, credit revenue
        sharing) that create sustainable economic opportunities
        for indigenous communities. Agreements specify equitable
        benefit distribution.
      indicators:
        - Household income from ecosystem service payments
        - Employment in conservation activities
        - Equitable benefit distribution ratios

    pacto_alignment:

      mechanisms: [m022, m023]
      description: >
        PACTO formalizes partnerships between indigenous communities,
        conservation organizations, and market actors. Living contracts
        (m022) define multi-stakeholder governance with clear roles
        and community authority.
      indicators:
        - Active multi-stakeholder agreements
        - Partner compliance with agreement terms
        - Community satisfaction with partnerships

        Water quality is a common biocultural indicator in Amazonian
        contexts. Community-defined water health indicators may be
        included in PACTO agreements.
      indicators:
        - River water quality indices
        - Watershed protection coverage
        - Community water access

      Siekopai pilot directly produces USS01-compatible credits.
      PACTO provides the biocultural indicator co-definition process
      that maps community knowledge to the USS01 composite index.

      Soil carbon credits could include PACTO biocultural co-benefits
      for projects in indigenous territories where community-defined
      indicators complement scientific soil measurements.

  notes: >
    PACTO SDG alignments should be consistent with SDG codes defined in
    regen-data-standards. When creating BioculturalIndicator objects,
    the sdg_alignment field should reference standard SDG codes (e.g., "SDG:15")
    as defined in the regen-data-standards SDG.yaml.
